# Problem

Lack of Safety and the high rate of insecurities amongst Nigerians 
which caught across all ages, genders, and all walks of life.

The security and other safety agencies have also not been convincing 
enough to curb the insecurity menace.

# Proposed Solution
A PWA that alerts registered users' relatives, friends and neighbours when
they are in emergencies or when they witness an emergency. 

Prior to the emergency, a registered user must have inputted his/her desired 
people to be alerts in case of an emergency. In an emergency situation that involves
the registered user, the user just needs to trigger a button an all the user's
pre-created alert recipients will receive an alert on the location of the user 
with request for rescue.

In a situation that does not actively involve a registers user, such user can alert
all users of the app, so that they can be cautious and also to possibly get help
for the victims.


# Proposed Stack

Node, VueJs and MySql

# Benefit

- To check and drastically reduce insecurity amongst Nigerians
